> ### Prototype: Basic Searching Algorithm Using IBM Watson ###

Using IBM Watson's default Natural Language Processing Model, in conjunction with NASA API to the Image and Video Gallery, images relating to the user's search are returned to the user along with their respective descriptions. Using our prototype model, the user is directed to first input a phrase, similar to how a user will do so in the stART exploring app, which will first be run through the IBM Watson's natural language processing model to identify "entites" in the user's phrase, and it will be used to search the NASA Image and Video Gallery for any corresponding matches. All images on the first page(which can be expanded to all accessable pages, for the sake of time however, we have limited our prototype to only accessing results that come up to a maximum of 100 results) and their respective descriptions will be returned. If there are no matches, the user will be notified. The list of images and their respective descriptions can be altered to serve the role of displaying all matched images on the stART exploring app, where the user can review images, read their descriptions, edit the images, etc.

> ### Speech To Text Transcription ###

This program file is a sample implementation of speech to text transcription in python. Using the concept app stART exploring, all users can access the myriad of data offered by the NASA APIs. The Speech To Text function in our app is an integral part that allows even the illiterate or immobile to explore the possibilities enveloped in space, as such, we developed a speech to text implementation that puts this concept into action(code). Using the program, the user can record themselves talking, and the system will automatically convert the recording into a phrase. Some further developments that can be made in this program include adding multi-language support, to further the accessibility for all to make SPACE for everyone.
